# schoolproject
This code was created to help teachers to store students data accurately.
The csv that was generated from the python code would serve as a spreadsheet that each subject teacher would have if a school uses this code project.(students_data.csv)
The generated csv file was further analysed in jupyter notebook; matplotlib was used to make data visualisations.
